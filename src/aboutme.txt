About Me
I’m a recent graduate from the University of Michigan with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, focused on systems engineering and infrastructure, software development, and data science and machine learning.

My work spans low-level systems projects — including a virtual memory pager, a multithreaded file server, and custom threading libraries in C and C++ — as well as applied machine learning and full-stack development. I’ve built end-to-end applications like WaitFast, a mobile app with a live Flask/AWS backend, and explored deep learning through computer vision and reinforcement learning projects using PyTorch.

This portfolio highlights a selection of these projects, with technical breakdowns, source code, and reflections on the challenges tackled and lessons learned.

My Projects
Systems & Infrastructure
Multithreaded File Server – C++
Designed and implemented a networked file server supporting concurrent client requests and hierarchical path traversal. The server communicates over TCP sockets and ensures crash consistency and correctness through atomic disk writes and thread-safe I/O using RAII and Boost locks.
Skills: Multithreading, RAII, Boost Locks, Socket Programming, File Systems

Virtual Memory Pager – C++
Built a virtual memory subsystem that handles page faults, copy-on-write behavior, and page eviction using the clock algorithm. The pager simulates real-world memory management logic, including read/write protections and shared memory scenarios across processes.
Skills: Virtual Memory, Page Tables, MMU Simulation, Copy-on-Write, Clock Algorithm

Custom Thread Library – C++
Developed a cooperative user-level threading library using ucontext.h, supporting thread scheduling, context switching, and synchronization primitives like mutexes and condition variables.
Skills: Thread Scheduling, ucontext, Mutexes, Condition Variables

LC-2K Assembler & Pipeline Simulator – C
Wrote a full assembler and 5-stage pipelined simulator for the LC-2K instruction set, with support for label resolution, instruction decoding, and pipeline hazard mitigation. Skills: Systems Programming, Assembly, Pipeline Simulation

LC-2K Cache Simulator – C
Simulated a parameterized LRU cache system with support for configurable block and set sizes. Logged memory operations to validate eviction policy and cache performance under various workloads.
Skills: Memory Management, Cache Simulation, LRU Policy

Traveling Salesman Solver – C++
Implemented a TSP solver combining minimum spanning tree heuristics, nearest insertion, and optimized branch & bound search to compute near-optimal tour paths.
Skills: Algorithm Design, MST, Heuristics, Bash Scripting

Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, & Machine Learning
Power Outage Analysis – Python & ML
Built a regression pipeline to estimate the financial cost of power outages using Random Forests. Focused on extensive feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization on real utility data.
Skills: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Regression, Hyperparameter Tuning

Stock Prediction Pipeline – Python
Developed an end-to-end forecasting system for stock prices, integrating live data scraping, technical indicators, and models like LSTM and Random Forests to predict future price movements.
Skills: Time Series Forecasting, API Integration, Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM

AlphaZero Othello – Python & AI
Trained an AlphaZero-inspired agent using Monte Carlo Tree Search and a deep neural network for board evaluation and policy guidance. Self-play loop built for continuous model improvement.
Skills: PyTorch, Reinforcement Learning, MCTS, Neural Networks

CIFAR-10 Classifier – Python & AI
Built image classification models on CIFAR-10 using CNNs and fully connected networks. Ran grid search over architectures and training hyperparameters to compare accuracy and convergence.
Skills: PyTorch, CNNs, Hyperparameter Tuning

Connect Four AI – Python
Engineered a perfect-play Connect Four AI using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a hand-crafted evaluation function. Includes an interactive UI with Pygame.
Skills: AI Search Algorithms, Game Theory, Pygame

Mobile & Full-Stack Development
WaitFast – Python, Swift, SQL
Built an IOS mobile app that crowdsources and displays real-time wait times at local venues. Backend includes a live Flask API, PostgreSQL database, and AWS-hosted infrastructure.
Skills: iOS UI/UX, Flask, AWS, PostgreSQL, Google & Apple APIs, Version Control
