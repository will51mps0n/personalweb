▌ This is my portfolio website. I am doing snap scroll so each page is its own, and I like how it functions. Also, do not change anhything going foward on mobile view.   

Experience timeline — move everything up & re-center the popover

Reduce top spacing of the whole “Experience” section

In the CSS for the experience section container (the element that wraps the title “EXPERIENCE” and the timeline), decrease its top padding/margin by 80–120px total.

If the section uses a utility like padding-top: clamp(...), lower the minimum and middle values accordingly so large screens don’t push it down.

Also reduce the bottom margin of the “EXPERIENCE” H1 by ~24–32px (it’s adding extra vertical gap).

Likely issue: The section has generous padding-top and the H1 has a big margin-bottom, so the timeline sits too low on desktop.

Shift the entire timeline block upward without breaking the line position

On the timeline wrapper (the element that contains the gradient line + nodes + popover cards), apply a negative top margin of -40 to -60px or reduce its own padding-top if it has one.

Do not move internal children individually; the wrapper must move as a unit so the line, nodes, and cards stay aligned.

Likely issue: The wrapper has extra padding-top (or sits inside a grid row with gap) so moving children individually caused misalignment with the line.

Center the expanding card (popover) on the node

In the CSS for the popover/card that expands from a node:

Ensure its anchor position is horizontally centered on the node by setting its left reference to the node center and using transform: translateX(-50%) (not translate by a fixed pixel).

If the card is above the line, use transform: translate(-50%, -8px) or a small negative Y to keep it close; avoid large, hard-coded offsets.

Remove any asymmetric padding or shadow offsets that visually push the card right; the card’s container should have equal left/right padding.

Connector arrow (if any) must point to the node center: set its left to 50% of the card and translateX(-50%).

Likely issue: The card is positioned with a fixed left or translateX(-40px) style tied to one screen size, so it’s visually off-center relative to the node.

Align the node dot to the line perfectly

Make the node’s center equal the line’s center by:

Positioning the line at exactly 50% of the timeline wrapper’s height (top: 50%).

Positioning each node with top: 50% and transform: translate(-50%, -50%) so the circle center sits right on the line.

Remove any extra translateY used to nudge nodes separately; all nodes must share the same vertical formula.

Likely issue: Nodes use translateY(-40%) or the line uses top: calc(50% + 6px), producing slight vertical drift and the card then looks “off.”

Experience timeline — synchronize animations (no element should appear before the others)

Use one reveal trigger for the whole timeline group

Wrap line + nodes + cards in a single .timeline-group and add only one “revealed” class (e.g., .is-visible) to that wrapper via IntersectionObserver.

Remove element-specific timeouts/delays that cause the line to draw before nodes (e.g., transition-delay on the line or on node scale).

Set identical transition durations and zero delay for line, nodes, and initial card opacity/slide so they fade/scale in together.

If you want a micro-stagger, keep it ≤ 60ms evenly across nodes so it still reads as one moment.

Likely issue: The line animates width with a delay (e.g., 200ms) while nodes scale from 0 to 1 with no delay, or vice versa. Also, nodes/cards might be listening to a different visibility flag than the line.

Guard for images/logos loading

Ensure the reveal doesn’t start until logos in nodes (SVG/PNG) have fired load. Add a data-ready check or wait for imagesLoaded equivalent before adding .is-visible to .timeline-group.

Likely issue: The line animates on time, but node logos load slightly later, so it feels like the line appears first.

IntersectionObserver settings

Use threshold: 0.2 and rootMargin: "0px 0px -10% 0px" so the group triggers only when a meaningful portion is in view, preventing early line-only reveals when the top padding enters the viewport.

Projects list — move the whole list up and balance the page

Reduce top spacing on the “Select Projects” section

Lower the section’s top padding/margin by 60–100px.

Reduce the H1 margin-bottom by ~16–24px (the big title is pushing the content down).

If the grid container has a large row gap above the list (e.g., from a hero spacer), reduce that gap by ~24px.

Keep the list and the right preview box matched vertically

Ensure the list container and the right preview pane share the same top alignment reference (e.g., both start at the same grid row start).

If the preview pane has its own padding-top or a border radius making it look lower, reduce that padding by 12–16px so the top edges visually align.

Likely issue: The list sits in a grid column with extra top gap, while the preview pane has additional internal padding, making the two look misaligned and “heavy” at the bottom.

Clean up “where it’s messing up”

Too much section top padding and title margin are pushing both the timeline and the project list too low.

Popover is anchored with fixed horizontal offsets instead of centering relative to the node (use left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%) logic).

Nodes and line don’t share the exact same vertical center math (mixed top/translateY values), causing a small but visible offset.

Animations are triggered by different classes and delays, so the line and nodes/cards appear out of sync.

Logos inside nodes aren’t gated on load, so they “pop” late even when the line is already drawn.

Projects section’s grid/padding combo leaves extra whitespace above the list and a slightly lower preview pane.

Acceptance criteria (so Claude knows when it’s “done”)

On desktop (≥1280px):

The timeline’s first node center sits ~220–260px below the “EXPERIENCE” title (not 340–380px).

When a node expands, the card’s left/right margins are symmetric around the node; connector (if any) points to node center.

Scrolling the section into view shows line, nodes, and any default-visible card fading in at the same moment (no element leads by more than 60ms).

On the “Select Projects” page:

The top of the list and the top of the right preview frame align within 8px.

There is visually equal breathing room above the title and below the content (no bottom-heavy layout).
